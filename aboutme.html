        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently a junior working on my BS in Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. 
            On campus, I have worked as a Resident Assistant in Residential Life for 2 years. A fun fact about myself is that I have 
            traveled to Italy, Switzerland, and France. My most prized posession is an original release from 1977 of Fleetwood Mac's Rumors 
            album on vinyl.

        <h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite movie varies from time to time, but my favorite movie series is the Harry Potter series. My family and I would read
            the Harry Potter books together as a family and we continued that tradition when the movies came out; they've been a big part of
            my childhood. If I had to pick a favorite movie from that series, I would have to say that Harry Potter and the Order of the 
            Phoenix is my favorite movie.
