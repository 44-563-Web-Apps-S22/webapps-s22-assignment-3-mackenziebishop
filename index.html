        <h2>Favorite Place to Get Food: Chen's Buffet</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Chen's Buffet</b> is a Chinese restaurant in my hometown of Paola, Kansas. It's located just outside of town, next to our
            Dollar General and our hair salon. It rivals another Chinese restaurant in our town, <b>Spring of China</b>, but I prefer Chen's
            Buffets' selection and crab rangoon over anything Spring of China has.
